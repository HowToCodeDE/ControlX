# ControlX
A window with custom controls for every window
## How it works
ControlX uses a websocket-wrapper for interproccess-communication. Any programm, or even a webpage can request ControlX to draw control elements, e.g. for quick navigation. There will be a documentation and a list with wrappers in different programming languages soon.

## Known issues
 - Not working on fullscreen-windows in macOS
 
 ## Current state
 I'm currently only working of a macOS-version of the app. Later I will do it also for Linux and Windows. There isn't any funcionality atm so there is no reason why you should build a version rigth now.
 
 ## How to build
 Soon:tm:
 
 ## How to install
 Head over to the release-section.
 But there is no release atm
