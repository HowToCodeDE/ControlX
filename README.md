# ControlX
A window with custom controls for every programm
## How it works
ControlX uses a websocket-wrapper for interproccess-communication. Any programm, or even a webpage can request ControlX to draw control elements, e.g. for quick navigation. There will be a documentation and a list with wrappers in different programming languages soon.

## Known issues
 - Not working on fullscreen-windows in macOS (Does work in Windows, idk why Apple sucks like that)
 - Transparency and frameless not working in Windows
 
## Current state
I'm currently only working on macOS and Windows versions of the app. Later I will do it also for Linux. There isn't any funcionality atm so there is no reason why you should build a version rigth now.

## How to build
Soon:tm:

## How to install
Head over to the release-section.
But there is no release atm
